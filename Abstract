In this notebook we are doing a simple visualization creating Choropleth Maps at county level. For this example we are using data released by Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) for March 30, 2020 and the US county dataset (https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a00d6b6149b34ed3b833e10fb72ef47b). This notebook creates choropleth maps of confirmed cases, deaths, cases per-capita and deaths per-capita for all of USA, continental US, and Illinois.
